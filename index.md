```
markdwon_learn = 'It seems fun to learn MarkDown.'
print(markdown_learn)
```
My first session of learning MarkDown:
- [ ] Follow the instructions
- [ ] Identify questions on things I don't understand
- [ ] Find answers on those questions
- [ ] Find a basic project which I can use my learned Markdown skills.
- [ ] Do the project
- [ ] Review and make notes
- [ ] Build tests with Chatgpt to help me review about the Markdown skills I learned.
